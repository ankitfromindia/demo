//Create a matrix with alternating rectangles of O and X
//
//Write a code which inputs two numbers m and n and creates a matrix of size m x n (m rows and n columns) in which 
//every elements is either X or 0. The Xs and 0s must be filled alternatively, the matrix should have outermost rectangle of Xs, 
//then a rectangle of 0s, then a rectangle of Xs, and so on.
//
//Examples:
//
//Input: m = 3, n = 3
//Output: Following matrix 
//X X X
//X 0 X
//X X X


//
//Input: m = 4, n = 5
//Output: Following matrix
//X X X X X
//X 0 0 0 X
//X 0 0 0 X
//X X X X X
//
//Input:  m = 5, n = 5
//Output: Following matrix
//X X X X X
//X 0 0 0 X
//X 0 X 0 X
//X 0 0 0 X
//X X X X X
